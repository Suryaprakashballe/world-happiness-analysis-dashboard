# 🌍 World Happiness Analysis Dashboard  
### Python Data Analysis & Visualization Project

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Happiness is influenced by multiple socio-economic and well-being factors such as
GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, freedom, and corruption perception.
However, understanding **which factors most strongly influence happiness across countries**
and how happiness varies globally requires data-driven analysis.

The objective of this project is to analyze the **World Happiness dataset** using Python
to identify key drivers of happiness and present insights through clear visualizations
and an interactive dashboard.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** World Happiness Report (public dataset)
- **Coverage:** Multiple countries across several years
- **Key Features:**
  - Happiness Score
  - GDP per Capita
  - Healthy Life Expectancy
  - Social Support
  - Freedom to Make Life Choices
  - Perceptions of Corruption
  - Regional Information
- **Note:**  
  The dataset is publicly available and widely used for global well-being analysis.

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Pandas – data manipulation
  - NumPy – numerical operations
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualizations
  - Plotly (if applicable) – interactive charts
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🔍 Approach / Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the World Happiness dataset
2. Performed data cleaning and handled missing values
3. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Analyzed relationships between happiness score and key factors
5. Created visualizations to compare regions and countries
6. Built a dashboard-style visual narrative to communicate insights

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Distribution of Happiness Scores across countries
- Correlation between GDP per capita and Happiness Score
- Impact of life expectancy and social support on happiness
- Regional comparison of happiness levels
- Identification of top and bottom happiest countries

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Countries with higher GDP per capita generally report higher happiness scores
- Social support and healthy life expectancy show strong positive relationships with happiness
- Regional differences in happiness are clearly visible
- Economic factors alone do not fully explain happiness; social factors play a major role
- Some countries outperform others despite similar economic conditions

## 📸 Dashboard / Visualization Preview
The dashboard visualizes:
- Global happiness distribution
- Relationship between GDP per capita and happiness
- Regional happiness comparisons
- Factor-wise contribution to happiness
